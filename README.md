# Bi-criteria-Search-Algorithms

## Description 

A project at the SPbU. Pathfinding algorithms.

This project uses

+ [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) - for parsing arguments
+ [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) - for visualizing with Python

## Getting started

For project build you should have compiler on C++17 standart.
For example, you can install it with 
```
sudo apt install build-essential 
```
This project should be built with CMake.
For example, you can install it with
```
sudo apt install cmake
```
Also you will need Boost library.
For example, you can install it with
```
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev   
```



## Installing

To download current repository to your local machine use
```
git clone https://github.com/bagrorg/Bi-criteria-Search-Algorithms
```

To build the project follow the guide
```
~$  cd Bi-criteria-Search-Algorithms/
~$  mkdir build
~$  cd build
~$  cmake ..
~$  make -j nproc
```

## Arguments
You can manage settings of execution using arguments.

+ `algo` - wich algorithm to use. Now supported - BOA* and PP-A*.
+ `report_path` - where to save execution description
+ `graph_path` - path to graph description file
+ `iterations` - how much executions to provide
+ `eps_dist`, `eps_time` - epsilons for PP-A* algorithms for distance cost and time cost
+ `start_id`, `goal_id` - indexes of start and goal vertexes
+ `history_path` - where to save history of OPEN and CLOSEd

Also you can run explanation with 
```
./main --help
```

## Input and output
### 3 sepparate files
For input there must be 3 files:
+ file with time cost
+ file with distance cost
+ file with coordinates

Indexing of vertices must starts from 1!
Format:
+ file with time/distance cost
Lines must be like
```
p sp {count of vertices} {count of edges}

a {vertex from} {vertex to} {time/distance cost}
```

+ file with coordinates
Lines must be like
```
p sp {count of vertices} {count of edges}

v {vertex index} {x} {y}
```

After this, you can merge this files to one with script `mergeGraphFiles.py`. To check how to use this script see [Scripts](Scripts). This file you will need for execution

### 1 file
+ file with time, distance and coordinates
Lines must be
```
p sp {count of vertices} {count of edges}
v {vertex index} {x} {y}
a {vertex from} {vertex to} {time cost} {distance cost}
```
Indexing of vertices must starts from 0!

You can find examples [here](https://github.com/bagrorg/Bi-criteria-Search-Algorithms/tree/master/Examples/Graphs).

## Scripts
+ `mergeGraphFiles.py {time path} {dist path} {coord path} {output path}` - merging 3 graph files at `{time path}`, `{dist path}` and `{coord path}` to one at `{output path}`. Indexing must starts from 1.


+ `dijkstra.py {input graph path} {output path} {vertex id}` - counting dijkstra results (for heuristics) using graph at `{input graph path}` for `{vertex id}` vertex and saving it at `{output path}` in format
```
{vertex id} {result}
```
Indexing must starts from 0.
+ `renderHistory.py {history path} {graph path} {output path} {start id} {goal id} {duration} {max frames}` - making a gif from hastory file at `{history path}` using graph at `{graph path}` and saving it at `{output path}`. History is for path starting at `{start id}` and ending at `{goal id}`. `{duration}` and `{max frames}` - settings for gif output. Can be `-1` for default. Indexing must starts from 0.

+ `serviceForDijkstra.py` - contains interfaces for `dijkstra.py`
